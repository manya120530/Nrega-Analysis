# Nrega-Analysis
This project analyzes NREGA data, a government scheme providing guaranteed wage employment to rural households. The dataset includes job cards issued, workforce engaged, budget allocation, and work completion stats. Using data analytics, we aim to gain insights into NREGA's implementation and impact across India's states and districts.
